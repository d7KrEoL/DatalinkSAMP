## Pawn script
Is server-side, can be installed to samp server and send full information of all players or every selected player on server.

## Moonloader lua script

Is client-side, can be installed on San Andreas game. It can send only information that player on server have. There is 2 different versions of this script:

#### For San Andreas Multiplayer with moonloader and sampfuncs installed

This one is using game to get data. So you should load your gta samp to transmit anything. This type of scripts can affect fps in your game, especially on low-perfomance PCs

#### For RakSAMP bot with moonloader installed

This script allow not to load gta game but use Rak bot instead. It works more stable, but bots are not permitted on some servers
